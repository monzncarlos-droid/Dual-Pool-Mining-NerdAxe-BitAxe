"""Catch a miner's crash log before it is gone.

Miners here reboot without warning - a stratum outage makes the firmware stop
mining and restart - and by the time anyone looks, the evidence has rotted.
How it rots differs by firmware, and that difference drives this whole tool:

  AxeOS (BitAxe)     keeps ~23 minutes of log in a RAM ring buffer and it
                     SURVIVES a soft reboot (log_buffer.c: "Soft reboot
                     detected, N bytes of logs preserved"). Fetching
                     /api/system/logs promptly after a reboot therefore still
                     yields the pre-crash lines. That is how the 2026-09-01
                     GammaX4 panic was traced to a stratum failure.

  NerdOS (NerdAxe,   has NO log endpoint at all. /api/system/logs returns 404
  NerdQAxe)          and the only log path is the /api/ws websocket, a LIVE
                     stream that retains nothing. Once the miner reboots its
                     pre-crash log is gone; no amount of polling afterwards
                     brings it back.

So on NerdOS the log has to be captured BEFORE the crash or not at all, which
means holding the websocket open and buffering it. That is opt-in (--stream)
and deliberately not the default: NerdOS serves exactly one log client
(`int websocket_fd = -1` in http_websocket.cpp), so streaming takes the log
view away from that device's own dashboard for as long as this runs.

    python tools/panic_capture.py 192.168.50.149 192.168.50.243      # AxeOS
    python tools/panic_capture.py 192.168.50.210 --stream            # NerdOS

Stdlib only, except `websockets`, which is needed only for --stream. Read-only:
it never writes to a miner.
