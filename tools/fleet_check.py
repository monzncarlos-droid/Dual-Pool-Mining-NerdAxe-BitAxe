"""Fleet health check for SerpentX dual-pool miners.

Reads /api/system/info from each miner and prints a compact health line.
Handles both firmware families:
  * AxeOS (BitAxe)          - flat stratumURL, has errorPercentage
  * NerdOS (NerdAxe/NerdQAxe) - stratum.pools[] array, no errorPercentage

On the dual-pool AxeOS fork, devices with dualEnable on also get a Pool B line
(poolBUrl/poolBSharesAccepted/poolBSharesRejected/poolBStaleDrops). Devices
without those fields, or with Pool B configured but switched off, are
unaffected - they render exactly as before.

With --ws it also probes the live websocket. That check exists because a
silent-but-connected websocket is not hypothetical: the dashboard trusts an
open socket and stops polling HTTP, so a mute socket shows up to the user as
"Unable to reach the device" while the miner is perfectly healthy. A connect
test alone would have missed that - what matters is whether frames arrive.

Stdlib only, except `websockets`, which is needed only for --ws.

    python tools/fleet_check.py --scan 192.168.50
    python tools/fleet_check.py 192.168.50.243 192.168.50.144 --ws

Exits non-zero if any miner needs attention, so it can gate a release.
